Arduino-DHT11-Thingspeak
========================

This arduino sketch uses a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity. These readings are then sent to www.thingspeak.com using an ethernet connection.

An Arduino Uno, a HanRun ethernet shield, and a DHT11 sensor was used to develop and test this sketch.
